      <p>My story was baced on a true story about myself and how i changed my life after i was caught in a cross fire and was shot 2times after coming from my first homecoming as a freshman. HERE IS MY STORY BLOW<P/>
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    <P>SKY'S THE LIMIT</P> 
The rain pours down as me and my three friends dt, drizzy,and my older friend who was driving diamond sit in all black charger with tinted windows. after I left my first homecoming of the year for me because. I was a freshman but for them it was their second or third homecoming. because they were older than me while. I sit in the front seat and my friend dt, and drizzy were in the back seat they started to mentioning the homecoming. Smiles took over our faces while we crack jokes about how the homecoming was. And how many girls were there and how everybody was dancing on us and around us. 

Then as I  leaned back laughing after dt cracks a joke about a girl in homecoming dancing to hard. And her piece fell off then out of nowhere you hear "Boom" I seen my friend dt try to open the left side door. Then on the other side i saw my friend drizzy duck in the back seat as the bullets clashes the window  my friend dt says " I'm hit bro run" as I reached for the door. And open it after balling up in my seat "Boom" as my foot reached out the door i was hit in my left leg as I  yell out "ahhh" as I tied to still run in fear of my life. As i turned around my left leg took pressure and as I was falling outside the door while it was halfway open "Boom" "Boom"  I was hit in my lower chest. As I finally fall all I can think about is my family and revenge i knew I was going to die right there on the sidewalk as I was stuck in between the car. 

And the curb I tried talking to myself as i was someone else Amar Get Up You Good Bro" as I was talking all I could do is think about what my daddy would say. After I felt pain I gasp for air everything went blank I could hear anything any more. But I can still feel the concret as laid there I almost pee on myself but then i finally open my eyes after someone was operating on me. As I hear a female voice I gasp for air again. And could breathe as i choked i tried taking it slow as I was breath with little breath had left as she laid her warm hands on my forehead i knew I would be okay. after seeing clearly I saw the greatest women of my life crying her eyes out.  As I looked down my mother was holding my hand and was praying. Then I think back to my childhood I wasn't a bad child growing up I was just was at the wrong place at  the wrong time. And I promise myself I would never put myself or my friend in a situation like that again 

After that night and recovering from them two bullets wounds it was hard for me to see clearly again. But after a while i thought about my life and to make it different and to make myself work harder and chase my dreams more i love my life and i promised myself i would never play with my blessing again. and when i can breath well again i was going to take deep!</p>
